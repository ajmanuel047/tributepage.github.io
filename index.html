        <h2>Famous Quotes By Alistair Cockburn</h2>
        <div class="column">
          <div class="first spacing">
            Focusing on skills, communications, and community allows the project to be more effective and more agile than focusing on processes and plans.
          </div>
          <div class="second spacing">We get things wrong before we get things right</div>
          <div class="third spacing"> A well-functioning team of adequate people will complete a project almost regardless of the process or technology they are asked to use (although the process and technology may help or hinder them along the way)</div>
          <div class="fourth spacing">I consider C++ the most significant technical hazard to the survival of your project and do so without apologies</div>
          <div class="fifth spacing">We are still in the infancy of naming what is really happening on software development projects</div>
          <div class="sixth spacing">Agile is an attitude, not a technique with boundaries. An attitude has no boundaries, so we wouldn't ask 'can I use agile here', but rather 'how would I act in the agile way here?' or 'how agile can we be, here?'</div>
